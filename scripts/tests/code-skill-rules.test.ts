// This file is the record of the four rules this plugin's own TypeScript is
// held to, taken from its code skill, `iso-24495-code`, by the owner's
// ruling. The skill states the first three in words. It states the fourth
// only by example: every error it shows is an Error, and the Google guide
// makes that a rule. Each rule is checked by the tool that states it most
// simply.
//
// 1. Entry point first. A reader opening a module meets what it does before
//    the detail. The first function of each shipped module is exported, and
//    a command shim's module leads with the function the shim runs. Tests are
//    not held to it, by the owner's ruling. decimal.ts is listed below with
//    its reason. Tested here.
// 2. Interface comment present. A caller learns what a function does without
//    reading its body. Every top-level export has a JSDoc comment, tested in
//    source-comments.test.ts. A comment on a function that throws says what
//    it throws, tested here.
// 3. Helpers at top level. A reader cannot reach a closure without reading
//    its container first. A function declaration, a variable holding a
//    function, or an object method or accessor inside a function is refused
//    by the "code skill" syntax selector in eslint.config.mjs, probed in
//    lint-rules.test.ts. A property holding an arrow is left alone: it is a
//    value handed on, most often a stand-in for a dependency.
// 4. Throw only Error. A value that is not an Error carries no message and no
//    stack to the person who meets it. The lint rule
//    "@typescript-eslint/only-throw-error" refuses a thrown value typed any or
//    unknown, and a caught value may still be thrown on. RULE_EXCEPTIONS in
//    eslint.config.mjs names the one file that may throw a value typed
//    unknown: scripts/tests/traffic-snapshot.test.ts, whose tests stand in
//    for code outside this project. Probed in lint-rules.test.ts. A linter
//    cannot tell two statements of a file apart, so a test here holds that
//    file to its two approved throws, by their text. In the same way, a test
//    here holds the rethrows of a caught value to the three approved sites,
//    each with its reason, in APPROVED_RETHROWS.
//
// eslint.config.mjs also records the eight lint rules that ESLint 11.0.0
// removes, beside the rules themselves.
//
// As with the lint rules, these checks catch accidents. A comment that names
// what a function throws and is wrong is left to review.
